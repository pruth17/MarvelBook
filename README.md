Created a social media website mockup using several data structure such as Graphs, BST, Stack, Queue, 
Linked List, Arrays and Hash Table.
Coordinated and managed a team of toal six developers to work in an agile environment.
Was incharge of recommendation part of project where I used the Breath First Search function of the graph to produce friends
recommendation of the user based on the current friends the user has.
Was also responsible for integrating all of my team work's work on different data structures into a main function and testing of
all their functions.
