Created a social media website mockup using several data structure such as Graphs, BST, Stack, Queue, 
Linked List, Arrays and Hash Table.
In the program, a user can login with a id and password and upon entering the correct password user can search for a person stored in the database based on name and interests. The user can also add a person as a friend, remove a friend, see the list of friends and get friend reccomendation. 
Coordinated and managed a team of toal six developers to work in an agile environment.
Was incharge of the recommendation part of project where I used the Breath First Search function of graph to produce friends
recommendation of the user based on the current friends the user has.
Was also responsible for integrating all of my team's work on different data structures into a single main function and testing all of their functions.
